# arduino2keyboard


arduino2keyboard is a simple software that allows you to use your arduino without hid cpabilitys as an mini keyboard(e.g. for a streamdeck). To start, download thsi repo, upload the arduino code(currently for 8 keys, will create a configurator for that soon...) and start createconfig.py. Now it will ask you to press a key and and the key taht should be emoulated. After the programm is done, you can launch main.py and enjoy it!

You need to install following requirements(or requirements.txt):
- pyautogui
- pyserial

There will be more docs very soon.
